# Henrik's Portfolio Website
This is my portfolio website - it's really just a landing page. Got some links to my Blog and I.T. Consulting + plus my Github and Twitter accounts. I built it with Next.js 12, React 17, and Tailwind CSS 3. I've also used Feather Icons. The current design varies depending on what I'm feeling, but currently it's based on the design principle of glassmorphism. I think its pretty.
