# Henrik's Website `v2`
This is the version 2 of my website. It was originally going to look and behave like a computer desktop, but I realized that the time investment for that was not worth it for me. Instead, the `v2` design and architecture of this site is heavily based off [Lee Robinson's website](https://leerob.io) with some of my own touches.
