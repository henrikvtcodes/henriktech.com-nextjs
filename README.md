# `website`: Henrik's Portfolio website
After nearly a year's journey from zero to hero, I finally present my personal portfolio. It's not quite done yet but its come a long way.

## Basic Architecture
This website is built with Next.js and React. It uses TailwindCSS / PostCSS for styling. I also chose DaisyUI for a basic selection of UI components.

## `content`: Sanity CMS
In the content folder, you'll find an instance of Sanity Studio. This is the CMS (Content Management System) that I chose to use.
