        Hey! My name is Henrik and I am a self-taught software dev, homelabber, unicyclist, and
        urbanist. I hail from the New York City metro area, and am a die hard New Jerseyan (gov phil
        murphy sucks though, he should support transit more) (also f*ck the port authority). I am
        currently studying computer science. My primary discipline is fullstack web dev (using
        Typescript), however I dabble in systems programming (with Rust) & some other stuff for
        classes. Overall, I am generally proficient in Typescript, Python, Java, Nix, Go, and Rust.
      </p>

        My homelab is somewhat geo-distributed, consisting of some VPSs and other mini pc's in my
        dorm, at home, and in relative's houses. All nodes run NixOS, and I use Tailscale to network
        my machines.
