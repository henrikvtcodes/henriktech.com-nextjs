    <p>
      i am a developer, homelabber, urbanist, & cs student. my primary discipline is fullstack web
      dev, however i dabble in systems programming (with Rust) & some embedded (arduino) stuff. i
      also like running my own thin-client based servers.
      <br />
      outside of tech, i also like to unicycle, ski, and make timelapses. big fan of equitable public
      transport as well.
      <br />
      i go by <code class="font-mono bg-gray-100 p-1 rounded-sm">@henrikvtcodes</code> on most platforms.
